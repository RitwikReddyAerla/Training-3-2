HTML:-
HTML is a mark up language. It is not a programming language

JavaScript:-
JavaScript is a high-level language. It is a loosely typed language. It is a lightweight and scripting language.

High-level : understandable by both humans and computers
loosely typed : not many restrictions while writing the code
lightweight : means we dont need a compiler to run the js code. We can directly run with the                       	      help js virtual machine which is present in the web browsers. 
Scripting language : The code is read by interpreter directly.

Js applications:-
-web pages
-mobile apps
-smartwatch apps (using pebble js)
-gaming applications
-database (mongoDB)
-ex:- uber, walmart, godaddy

Varibles:-
varoables are containers/memory blocks  to store values.
types:
-var: it can be re-initialized and re-declared
-let: it can be re-initialized and cannot be re-declared
-const: it cannot be re-initialized and re-declared.

ex:= int a  = 10 // let b = 20 // const c = 30
		console.log(a, b, c) //python equivalent of printing output


-Js file can be created with ending "filename.js".

previously we only had var variable. To avoid re-declaration other variables were eventually created.

Datatypes:-
-they can be used to mention what kind of data used in the variable.
Types:-
1.primitive : 	it can store single values.
	     	they are default
		String, number, Boolean, null, undefined

2.non-premitive : 	it can store multiple values.
	     		they are user defined
			functions, arrays, objects

1.String:
-Sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes/single quotes/backticks(``).
2.Number:
-It stores all the number datatypes such as integer, float values, etc..
3.Boolean:
-true or false
4.Undefined:
-any variable declared but not initialized.
5.numm:
-empty of object.

Operators:-
-operators are special type of symbols to perform some operations on operands.

ex:
2(operand1) *(symbol) 3(operand2)

*unary
*binary
*ternary

1.Arithmetic operator:-
-----------------------
+, - *, / , %, **, ++, --


concatenation : joining of two or more strings
typecasting : changing one datatype into another data type
NaN(not a number) : it is a special type number which is not legal in javascript

Increment:
1.pre-increment: it will increment the value by one before execution
1.post-increment: it will increment the value by one after execution


2.Assignment operator:
-----------------------
=, +=, -=, %=, *=
-relational operators always return Boolean values

3.Relational operators:-
------------------------
==, ===, !=, !==(strictly not equal to), >, >=, <, <=
diff btw == and ===
==: checks if the values of is equal
===: checks if the values and datatype is equal

4.Logical operators:-
----------------------
AND(&&) : it will return true only when both conditions are true else false
OR(||): it will return true if both conditions are true or any one condition is true
NOT(!): it will make true as false and false as true

Decision making statements:
-----------------------------
if : if block executes only when the condition is true
     we can give only one condition for if
if-else : this also 
else-if ladder
switch
ternary condition

Looping statements:-
--------------------
-looping statements are used to iterate the block of codes multiple times

1.for loop:
---------
-minimum iteration count of for loop is "0"
syntax:
for(initialization; condition; updation){
	//statements
}
2.while loop
------------
-minimum iteration count of while loop is "0"
syntax:
while(condition){
	//statement
	updation
}
3.do while:
-----------
-minimum iteration count of do while is "1"
syntax"
do{
	//statements
	while(condition)
